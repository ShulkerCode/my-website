        <h2>How You Can Support Us</h2>
       <p>
We’re a small group of students who are passionate about coding, learning, and building cool tech projects. Every day, we’re exploring new things—from writing code in Java and C++, to helping others with Linux and solving tech problems together. We're not a company or a professional team; we're just regular students trying to turn our curiosity into something meaningful. That’s why even the smallest support, whether it's sharing our work, giving feedback, financial support or just a few kind words, really means the world to us. It motivates us to keep going, keep learning, and keep building. Your support, no matter how small, helps us grow and continue doing what we love—while hopefully helping others along the way too.
